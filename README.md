# GraphQL Tutorial

### Task: Recreate the Rest API that I made for a project in college into a single GraphQL endpoint

1. Create a basic apollo server and add it as middleware for the app at /graphql
2. Convert your REST routes into typedefs and resolvers
3. Add a new front end javascript file that has the equivalents of the fetch requests except using graphqls syntax
